# Offseason Training 2022
Here are the completed lesson notes for programming training!

You can look at these if you've missed a lesson or if you want to look ahead a bit.

Practice questions are posted on the curriculum spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CAeXBYMCGT0Ky9WHXzjOMkSBi1ZfHMFSiVgB-rTb20E/edit#gid=0) to supplement your learning, although you will have to search for answers online by yourself.

Happy coding :))
